== Aimbot -> Rage

General mindset: +
Features that inherently improve aimbot speed cannot be disabled, such as `Engine Prediction`, unless they cause unavoidable issues.

* Option removals (enabled no matter what):
- `Engine Prediction`
- `Fast Aimbot`

* Option renames:

* New options:
- `Speed Hack` (moved from 'Misc' tab to 'Rage' tab)
** Speed amount cap moves from 22 to 1000; extreme speed-hack values break the game in unexpected ways that can give you massive advantages over other players.

== Chat
- Move all chat related features into this new tab.

== Config

* `Scaled GUI` -> `GUI Scaling`
- A slider that goes from 100% up to 350% in increments of 25%.

* `ESP Scaling`
- Separate from `GUI Scaling` but the same in terms of settings.

== Player -> Players
