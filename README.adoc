== BUGS
. `Rage` -> `NoLerp`
- Still reliant on lerp; `sv_client_min_interp_ratio -1; cl_interp_ratio 0; cl_interp 0` to see the massive accuracy increase on players (don't do this in the cheat, it's improper).

== Aimbot -> Rage

General mindset: +
Features that inherently improve aimbot speed cannot be disabled, such as `Engine Prediction`, unless they cause unavoidable issues.

* `Linear

* Option removals:
- `Engine Prediction` (always enabled)
- `Fast Aimbot` (??)
- `NoLerp` (remove for non-NPCs)


* New options:
- `Speed Hack` (moved from 'Misc' tab to 'Rage' tab)
** Speed amount cap moves from 22 to 1000; extreme speed-hack values break the game in unexpected ways that can give you massive advantages over other players.

== Chat
- Move all chat related features into this new tab.

== Config

* `Scaled GUI` -> `GUI Scaling`
- A slider that goes from 100% up to 350% in increments of 25%.

* `ESP Scaling`
- Separate from `GUI Scaling` but the same in terms of settings.
