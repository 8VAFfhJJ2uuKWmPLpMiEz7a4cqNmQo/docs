== Aimbot

General mindset: +
Features that inherently improve aimbot speed cannot be disabled, such as `Engine Prediction`, unless they cause unavoidable issues.

* Option removals (enabled no matter what):
- `Engine Prediction`
- `Fast Aimbot`
- `Hitboxes`

* Option renames:

== Chat
- Move all chat related features into this new tab.

== Config

* `Scaled GUI` -> `Scale factor`
- A slider that goes from 100% up to 350% in increments of 25%.

== Player -> Players
